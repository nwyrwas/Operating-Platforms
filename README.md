# Operating-Platforms

Hello everyone,

For this repository I worked on developing the documentation for The Gaming Room, I focused on the needs of our client, who wanted to expand their existing Android game, "Draw It or Lose It," into a web-based platform. They needed the game to be compatible across various operating systems, including macOS, Linux, and Windows. The game also required features such as support for multiple teams and players, ensuring unique names for games, teams, and players, and maintaining a single active instance in memory at any time. Additionally, I paid close attention to implementing timed rounds and post-time guessing to enhance the gameplay experience.

One aspect of this project that I believe I did particularly well was updating the main design constraints, adding an executive summary, and developing a comprehensive domain model. These updates were crucial in making sure the document was detailed and up to date, which provided a solid foundation for the development process.

Working through the design document was incredibly helpful when it came to coding. It provided me with a clear roadmap, minimizing potential issues during development. If I were to revise any part of my work, I might focus on enhancing the design constraints section, perhaps by adding more detailed specifications for the user interface or including additional technical details on implementing cross-platform compatibility. This would improve the clarity and practicality of the document.

Interpreting the user’s needs was a key part of my approach. I made sure to focus on cross-platform compatibility, user experience, and the importance of unique identifiers, all of which were crucial to making the game accessible and enjoyable across different systems. Considering the user’s needs is vital because it directly impacts the software's usability and overall success. A user-centered design ensures that the final product not only meets the client’s expectations but also aligns with the end-users' requirements.

In terms of my approach to designing the software, I began by thoroughly analyzing the requirements and considering various system architectures. I recommended a cross-platform, web-based solution that would meet the client’s needs. Moving forward, I would incorporate techniques such as iterative prototyping, user testing, and more detailed architecture documentation. These strategies would help refine the design process and ensure that it aligns with both the technical constraints and the needs of the users.
